# The puzzle begins with the disks stacked on one rod in order of 
# decreasing size, the smallest at the top, thus approximating a 
# conical shape. The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire 
# stack to the last rod, obeying the following rules:

# Only one disk may be moved at a time.

# Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks 
# and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.

# No disk may be placed on top of a disk that is smaller than it.

# With 3 disks, the puzzle can be solved in 7 moves. 
# The minimal number of moves required to solve a Tower of Hanoi 
# puzzle is 2n âˆ’ 1, where n is the number of disks.
